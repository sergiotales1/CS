## Don't be lazy. Make it natural (easier).

Don't be lazy writing your proofs = it'll be easier to understand the concepts in it in a near future and for others.

Don't be lazy, make it natural = simplify things to yourself and others with good proofs, this is going to build links in your brain and it will make natural to perform evaluations or execute tasks.

## Why do such complex proofs?

Pave the way for the next that are going to understand the concept you're proving, the easier you make it, more time you'll save trying to see it again when you forget what you've done.

### Concepts

Put some effort into planning, it'll pay off making the journey more natural.
Understand the problem and solution and the pitfalls will be less hidden.
