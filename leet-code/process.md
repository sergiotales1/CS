# Understand Why are we using what

# Linked list

Linked list is a non-contiguous data structure made of nodes that point to the next or prev nodes.

# Linked Lists and React Fiber Tree

I found this similarity with React Fiber. There we point to siblings, parents and child, just like a linked list does, we can traverse all the three only by having a single element of it.

## Bitwise

Bitwise operators can perform logic, comparison, math and transformations at the binary level. (0s and 1s)

# Algorithms

We need to memorize binary search and dfs

## dfs

Deep-first search? what is this ?

### Graph

Apparently we use dfs to search for nodes in graphs

What are graphs?

# How to write good and concise code?

Get to know the data! Check the roman_to_integer exercise and you will see a concise code that can only be like that because we know the constraints that roman numerals have. They can't have an X before an M for example, thus our job is much easier.

It's all about knowing the data. But how to know the data? Through constraints and validations! Assert that the data is formatted the way you want it to be and this is going to make your code a lot better on the long run.
