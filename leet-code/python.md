# To use utils.py

import utils as we are doing on remove_duplicates_from_sorted_list for example.

To run the file use:

cd leet-code
py -m problems.<folder>.<file>

for example:
py -m problems.remove_duplicates_from_sorted_list.index

# Todo

- Understand -m prefix
- What's this python cache folder?
  - They're just the binaries and make the execution faster, python usually only creates them when we are using an import inside the file.
