# React algorithm uses a tree similar to merge sort tree

I've spent some time looking how the react fiber tree works under the hood and i got an idea that is like [this](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*bkq3D0Dqyey2eRM9esq1hQ.png).

During the [lecture 3 - Insertion Sort, Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg4bqzAqRBM&t=505s), we can see the teacher drawing something like the react fiber tree. They look a like because both are divide-and-conquer algorithms.
